## 1. [Flight Delay Prediction Dashboard](https://github.com/smd519/data-analytics-portfolio/tree/main/Flight_Delay_Prediction_Dashboard)
'On-Time Aviation' is a machine learning based flight delay prediction dashboard," an innovative project that aims to develop an interactive dashboard to accurately predict flight delays for common routes.
+ The UI implementation: We used [D3](https://d3js.org/) to develop an html page containing all the UI elements including US map, capability to select source and destination on the MAP, curved line with arrowhead to show the flight between two airports, filters to choose date and airline, and tables to show the results.
+ Algorithm: A self paced ensemble with XGBoost was selected due to its efficacy in evaluating imbalanced and noisy datasets.
